makefile is for building in Linux environment.
Run “make” to create executable file adlutil
Run “make clean” to remove adlutil ( equivalent with “rm adlutil”)


Without the makefile, the easiest way to build this is to run the following command:

gcc main.c –o adlutil –DLINUX –ldl –I ../include/ 

-ldl (all lower cases), -I (capital i)
